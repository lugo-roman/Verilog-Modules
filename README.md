# Verilog-Modules
A collection of Verilog modules for digital design and FPGA development. Includes reusable building blocks for learning, experimentation, and hardware projects.

## Note. 

- the following modules are not working yet: demux and register_bank

## 1. Full Adder

**Description:**  
Combinational module that performs the addition of three binary inputs (two operands and one carry input). It produces a sum (`sum`) and a carry output (`cout`).

**Inputs:**  
- `a`: First input bit.  
- `b`: Second input bit.  
- `cin`: Carry input bit.

**Outputs:**  
- `sum`: Result of the addition of the three input bits.  
- `cout`: Carry output of the operation.

## 2. N-bit Adder

**Description:**  
Parametric combinational module that performs binary addition of two *n-bit* operands, including an input carry (`cin`). It outputs the resulting *n-bit* sum and the final carry-out (`cout`).

**Inputs:**
- **a:** First *n-bit* operand.  
- **b:** Second *n-bit* operand.  
- **cin:** Carry input bit.  

**Outputs:**
- **sum:** *n-bit* result of the addition.  
- **cout:** Carry output bit generated from the most significant bit (MSB) addition.

**Instantiation Format**

- n_bit_adder #(.N(N)) dut(.a(a), .b(b), .cin(cin), .sum(sum), .cout(cout));

## 3. N-bit Subtractor

**Description:**  
Parametric combinational module that performs binary subtraction between two *n-bit* operands, considering an input borrow (`bin`). It outputs the resulting *n-bit* difference and the final borrow-out (`bout`).

**Inputs:**
- **a:** First *n-bit* operand (minuend).  
- **b:** Second *n-bit* operand (subtrahend).  
- **bin:** Borrow input bit.  

**Outputs:**
- **diff:** *n-bit* result of the subtraction.  
- **bout:** Borrow output bit generated from the most significant bit (MSB) operation.

## 4. N-bit Comparator

**Description:**  
Parametric combinational module that compares two *n-bit* operands (`a` and `b`). It outputs three logic signals indicating whether the first operand is greater than, less than, or equal to the second.

**Inputs:**
- **a:** First *n-bit* operand to compare.  
- **b:** Second *n-bit* operand to compare.  

**Outputs:**
- **a_greater_b:** High when `a` is greater than `b`.  
- **a_equal_b:** High when `a` is equal to `b`.  
- **a_less_b:** High when `a` is less than `b`.

## 5. N-bit Multiplier

**Description:**  
Parametric combinational module that performs binary multiplication of two *n-bit* operands. It produces a product with a width of *2n* bits to represent the full result of the operation.

**Inputs:**
- **a:** First *n-bit* operand.  
- **b:** Second *n-bit* operand.  

**Outputs:**
- **product:** *2n-bit* result of the multiplication between `a` and `b`.
  
## 6. Simple ALU

**Description:**  
Combinational Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that performs basic arithmetic and logical operations between two *n-bit* operands. The specific operation is selected through a control signal (`op`). It outputs the resulting value and status flags as needed.

**Inputs:**
- **a:** First *n-bit* operand.  
- **b:** Second *n-bit* operand.  
- **op:** Control signal that selects the operation to perform.  

**Outputs:**
- **result:** *n-bit* output of the selected operation.  
- **carry_out (optional):** Carry flag generated by arithmetic operations.  
- **zero (optional):** High when the result equals zero.

## 7. Parametric Multiplexer

**Description:**  
Parametric combinational module that selects one input from multiple data sources based on a selection signal. The number of inputs and the bit width of each input can be adjusted through parameters.

**Inputs:**
- **data_in:** Vector containing all possible input signals.  
- **sel:** Selection signal that determines which input is routed to the output.  

**Outputs:**
- **data_out:** Selected input value corresponding to the `sel` signal.

## 9.1 Counter

**Description:**  
Sequential module that increments its value on each clock pulse. It can be reset to zero using the reset signal and is commonly used for timing, event counting, or state control.

**Inputs:**
- **clk:** Clock input signal.  
- **rst:** Active reset signal that clears the counter to zero.  

**Outputs:**
- **count:** Current value of the counter.

## 9.2 Up/Down Counter

**Description:**  
Sequential module that can increment or decrement its count based on a control input. It includes synchronous reset functionality and is useful for bidirectional counting applications.

**Inputs:**
- **clk:** Clock input signal.  
- **rst:** Active reset signal that clears the counter to zero.  
- **up_down:** Control signal that determines the counting direction (1 = up, 0 = down).  

**Outputs:**
- **count:** Current value of the counter.
