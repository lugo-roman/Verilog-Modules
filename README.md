# Verilog-Modules
A collection of Verilog modules for digital design and FPGA development. Includes reusable building blocks for learning, experimentation, and hardware projects.

### Full Adder

**Description:**  
Combinational module that performs the addition of three binary inputs (two operands and one carry input). It produces a sum (`sum`) and a carry output (`cout`).

**Inputs:**  
- `a`: First input bit.  
- `b`: Second input bit.  
- `cin`: Carry input bit.

**Outputs:**  
- `sum`: Result of the addition of the three input bits.  
- `cout`: Carry output of the operation.
